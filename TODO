  * Test recruiter on remote machines
  * Working directory is always ~/.fjd. Give workers and dispatcher a <project>
    name and work will be done in ~/.fjd/project. Screen names will also be 
    identified with it.
  * remote.conf can be passed to recruiter.py but it can also be placed in ~/.fjd
  * Scripts should be renamed with "fjd-" in front and maybe without ".py"
    Or we add three scripts with those names that simply import * from <>.py
    and include the __main__ part? Then we could actually have a "src" (or 
    "classes") and a "scripts" directory ...
  * Unit tests
